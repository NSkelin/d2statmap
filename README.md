In the game you can collect armor, each with their own unique stats.
By signing in, youâ€™ll be shown 6 unique heat maps, one for each stat type. The maps will be based on your selected character/class 
and all the armor you have for that class.

The goal of this app is to allow players (you) to tell at a glance which stats your current armor is lacking in. You then know what armor to prioritize.

# Features
## Heatmap
The heatmap is the main purpose of this app. It lets you see which stats your armor has a ton of, and which stats your armor is lacking.
You can also adjust the min / max stats show in the heat map.

You might have noticed that the heatbar gradient is chunky rather than smooth. This is by design as I believe it to be easier to tell where your stats 
start / end when its not a smooth gradient.
This can be changed in the [Options](#Options).

## Filters
These let you filter your armor by character class and armor type.

### Assume masterwork
In destiny 2, a masterworked armor has higher stat totals than its original piece. When masterworked, armor will gain a +2 to each stat for that
specific piece.

This setting, when checked will pretend that all the armor your own is masterworked and add that +2 to the armors stats. It will not
add +2 to already masterworked armor.

### Heatbar smoothing
When checked, this setting will make the [Heatmap](#Heatmap) gradient smooth, instead of chunky.

## Auto fetch
The app keeps up to date with destiny as you play it. The app will periodically search for any new armor you acquired to keep up to date.

This demo link lets you view the site without requiring a bungie account. It will provide dummy data in place of retrieving data from the
bungie api so you can play around with it.
